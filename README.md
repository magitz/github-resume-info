This site has been created to provide information on hosting your r√©sum√© online for free using [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using free r√©sum√© templates. Especially if you use GitHub to share code, I also cover setting up your [GitHub profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/about-your-profile).

## What is GitHub?
[Github.com](https://github.com/) is the leading site for building, delivering, and maintaining code. Using the industry standard [git](https://git-scm.com/) technology, GitHub.com provides an online resource for version control and hosting your portfolios. GitHub also provides GitHub Pages as a way of hosting free websites! 

## GitHub Pages: ‚ú®Freeüåü website hosting!

Any GitHub repositroy can have an associated website. This can either be on the main branch, or a branch dedicated to the web content.
