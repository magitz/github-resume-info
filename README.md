# GitHub For your Job Search

 > Using GitHub.com to host your r√©sum√© and profile for free!

![UFIT 2022 Tech Fair header image](images/TechFair2022.png)

This site has been created to provide information on hosting your r√©sum√© online for free using [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using free r√©sum√© templates. Especially if you use GitHub to share code, I also cover setting up your [GitHub profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/about-your-profile).

## What is GitHub?
[Github.com](https://github.com/) is the leading site for building, delivering, and maintaining code. Using the industry standard [git](https://git-scm.com/) technology, GitHub.com provides an online resource for version control and hosting your portfolios. GitHub also provides GitHub Pages as a way of hosting free websites! 

## GitHub Profile Page

Your profile page is what is displayed when someone navigates to your username on github.com. For example, here's mine: https://github.com/magitz

To create your profile page, create a git repository with the same name as your username. The README.md file in that repository is your profile page. Use Markdown to add content and format the page.

Checkout the [GitHub Documentation on Profile pages](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/about-your-profile).

> Note: If you want to have both a profile page and a website at your username.github.io, just publish your web content from the gh-pages branch of your repository!

## GitHub Pages: ‚ú®Freeüåü website hosting!

Any GitHub repositroy can have an associated website. This can either be on the main branch, or a branch dedicated to the web content.

## Frameworks for hosting on GitHub

GitHub Pages essentially uses static HTML to serve your site and most any [static site generator](https://www.google.com/search?q=static+site+generator) will likely work. I'm listing a few options, for your r√©sum√©, keep it simple, but if you want to explore other options for GitHub Pages, know that there are many!
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is the "official" GitHub framework and is the best documented/most common option
  * [Setup guide for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is also popular
